                I got a bus 'fore I got a house 'cause
                That's what dreams make you do
                Hittin' them neon honky-tonks
                To play a two step or two
                Two hundred days to a hundred towns
                Bringing boots to a sawdust floor
                While this six-string calls my name, baby
                I'll be missing yours

                Hang tight, honey, I'm a white line running
                Down a dream on a long lost highway
                Me and this band playing one night stands
                For some fans getting straight up sideways
                But baby, I miss your blue-collar kiss
                Just one more day to get through
                Hang tight, honey got a pocket full of money
                And I'm headed straight home to you

                Yeah, you can't hold me and I can't hold you
                From two time zones away
                When you're clocking out, yeah, I'm clocking in
                Getting ready to hit the stage
                Just know they're singing along to all them songs I wrote about you
                And I'll be saving all my loving for you come sunday afternoon

                Hang tight, honey, I'm a white line running
                Down a dream on a long lost highway
                Me and this band playing one night stands
                For some fans getting straight up sideways
                But baby, I miss your blue-collar kiss
                Just one more day to get through
                Hang tight, honey, got a pocket full of money
                And I'm headed straight home to you

                Yeah (yeah, yeah)
                I'm comin' home to you, baby

                Hang tight, honey
                Every good run comes to an end
                Hang tight, honey
                'Til I'm in your arms again

                Hang tight, honey, I'm a white line running
                Down a dream on a long lost highway
                Me and this band playing one night stands

                Hang tight, honey, got a pocket full of money
                And I'm headed straight home to you
